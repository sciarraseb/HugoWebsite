I'm Sebastian Sciarra and I am currently a PhD candidate in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology program at the University of Guelph. I am largely interested in statistics, coding, and machine learning, and have used my time as a graduate student learning a variety of topics in these areas while completing my dissertation. 


## Organization of Blog

I have set up this blog to contain the following three types of content: 

1) <a href="/technical_content">Technical Content</a>: contains posts that dive into the fundamentals of an analysis and, therefore, delve into the necessary calculus and algebra.
2) <a href="/coding_tricks">Coding Demonstrations & Tricks</a>: contains posts that explain useful pieces of code I have come across or constructed myself (whether in R, Python, SQL, Javascript, CSS, etc.). 
3) <a href="/simulation_exps">Simulation Experiments</a>: contains posts that show how an analysis works by coding the underlying math and/or how an analysis performs under a variety of conditions. 

I have also set up the <a href="/mlresources">ML Resources</a> page as a running list of useful resources I have come across over the years.
